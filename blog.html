                  “To learn a language is to have one more window from which to look at the world”. This saying is absolutely true about English language. Known as the ‘window to the world’, it opens up a lot of possibilities and developments for an individual. The importance of English is really prominent all over the world. This importance is traced back to the British Empire, which at its peak covered 25% of earth’s surface. During the colonial times, the British often compelled people in those countries to speak English rather than their native language. Even if the origin of English language is 
                  complicated, it has left an important mark on media, trade and business. </p>
                  <p>A lot of areas proclaim the importance of English language. One of the most prominent is how it opens up the possibilities for an individual. It gives you wings to fly all over the world and explore different things. As English is rightly called the global language, it is said that one out of five people can speak or at least understand the language. English is the official language of 53 countries and is used as lingua franca by people from all around the world. This means if you are working in Africa or travelling to Japan, studying English can help you have a conversation with people from all over the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    English is the predominant language in all fields of life. If you are someone who is enthusiastic about scientific advancements you will find yourself in need of learning English. In the last century, the number of scientific papers written in English has started to outweigh the number of papers written in the native language of the researcher. For this reason, having a knowledge of English is incredibly important to those working in the scientific fields and science enthusiasts.  
                    </p>
                    <p>English is also the most prevalent language of the media industry because of the dominance of Hollywood in global media, an enormous number of films, TV shows and popular songs are written in English. So, if you learn and speak English, you won’t need to rely on translations and subtitles anymore to enjoy your favourite books, songs, films and TV shows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When it comes to the most convenient technology ever found, internet, also projects English as an important language. More than half the content on the internet is written in English. English is one of the most important languages for business. It is considered so, due to being the de facto language of The United States, and the official language of the UK, Canada, India and South Africa.
                      </p>
                      <p>Finally, learning English gives you access to multiple cultures and provide with a first-hand experience. Good knowledge of English will allow you to access films, musics and literature from hundreds of countries around the globe.

                  Even after sporting the highest literacy rate, Keralites still face a lot of difficulty when it comes to speaking the Queen’s English. 
                  The poor English communication skills among a huge majority of Keralites validates to this fact. Even those who are highly educated try to disentangle from the situations when they are required to speak in English. The answer to why is it so is a complicated one.

                </p>
                <p>
                  The major problem behind the difficulty is not having a right place to learn. Even though English is a subject in all the government schools, the way it is being taught is really complicated starting from grammar, many schools struggle to provide a better standard of learning. Most of the time, English is not being taught by an English teacher, but teachers of other subjects. This is adversely affecting the quality of Keralites’ English language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another worrying aspect is the thick accent that Keralites are struggling with even though having an accent is not exclusive to Malayali alone, it is a real bummer when they are asked to speak especially in front of people who handle the language in a good way.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Bad communication skill is another factor that is troubling a huge number of Keralites, as lack of confidence and inability to pronounce words badly affect the language speakers of Kerala and they end up dreading the language as well as the situations where there is a need of communicating in English.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the preference for English as the medium of instruction in most of the schools, its communicative use is more or restricted to the public domain. Even if a person uses English to communicate, they will be interpreted as arrogant and “show-offish”. As this attitude is dominant in many Malayalees, those who love to speak English also restrict themselves, thereby losing the skills that they have acquired as a result of not having a good platform to speak.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion, all these problems point towards Keralite’s scarcity in not having a good stage to learn, practice and converse in English. All the above-mentioned troubles can be cleared by having a rostrum, when they are not going to be judged and also be provided with the much-needed confidence. Thus, English won’t be a rocket science anymore for Keralites.
